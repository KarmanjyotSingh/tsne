## Introduction

Data visualization provides an accessible way to see and understand trends, patterns in data, and outliers. Data visualization tools and technologies are essential to analyzing massive amounts of information and making data-driven decisions. Here we present the t-SNE algorithm for reducing the dimensions of the point and thus analysing the data.

## Implementation Pipeline


## Data Sets Used 

We used the following datasets for running and analysing our t-SNE algorithm.

1. **`MNIST`** :
    1. The MNIST data set6 contains 60,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits. For our experiments, we randomly selected 6,000 of the images for computational reasons. The digit images have 28 × 28 = 784 pixels (i.e., dimensions). 
    2. The data set used has 60k handwritten images of digits 0-9 ( black and white) which could be found at [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data?select=train.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data?select=train.csv)
2. **`Coil-20`** :
    1. The processed dataset, contains images for all of the objects in which the background has been discarded (and the images consist of the smallest square that contains the object)
    2. The data set could be found at [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/3defe8fe86a5eedce3906f162cc11b20dad9a7591fe713fd14308575cae47cdd](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/3defe8fe86a5eedce3906f162cc11b20dad9a7591fe713fd14308575cae47cdd)
3. **`Netflix`** :
    1. T*his tabular dataset consists of listings of all the movies and tv shows available on Netflix, along with details such as - cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc.*
    2. The dataset could be found at [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)
4. **`Olivetti`** : 
    1.   The Olivetti faces data set 7 consists of images of 40 individuals with small variations in viewpoint, large variations in expression, and occasional addition of glasses. The data set consists of 400 images (10 per individual) of size 92 × 112 = 10, 304 pixels, and is labeled according to identity. We used `sklearn` datasets for the Olivetti dataset.
